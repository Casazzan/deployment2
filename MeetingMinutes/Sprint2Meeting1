Minutes from Previous Meeting.
We talked about finishing the second MVP for the product. We implemented functions involving localstorage very heavily in the customer and server sides, and we asked nathan if that might affect anything and he said it might later on, so we are reconsidering what to do with it, however most things we’ve made work with local storage so the redesign would be extensive. We decided to work with what we’ve been working on and redesign later if needed. We need to finish the customer side backend communication and finish the customer side stylizations.
