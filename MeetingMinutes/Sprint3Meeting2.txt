Minutes from Previous Meeting
We decided we needed to make a public tab for customers. The tab won’t have ordering power, however the customer will be able to see what the restaurant has and make an educated decision on whether they want to eat there. This new tab also has google maps so the customer can find the nearest panda express and navigate to there. We had some trouble finding documentation apps for Javascript that work with React, we were still searching for a documentation app when we left the meeting, and assigned that task to anyone who didn’t have a job. We did a complete overhaul of the server side and now it displays the order and updates every time a new item is ordered or a new item is taken off the current order, which is in line with our users' demand for more user feedback. We are going to find a documentation app by the next SCRUM meeting.
