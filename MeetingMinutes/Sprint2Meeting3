Minutes from Previous Meeting
We decided we need to refactor the code for the customer and server side because it extensively uses local storage. We wanted to have the current order screen and price in the same screen as the screen that you selected the items in 0rder to provide the customer instant feedback. In order to do this we need to reload the current order and price function. We can’t tell when the option is benign erased with the local storage option so we had to rework our code to use react components. The time it took our backend guy was about 3 hours because it wasn’t too extensive, but we also have to change the server code because it uses the same local storage options. After this refractor we will start looking at API’s
