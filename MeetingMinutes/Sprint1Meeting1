Minutes from Previous Meeting
We discussed backend database communication and setting up the environment we will be working in. We pushed the repository to github and installed everything on everyoneâ€™s computer, making sure it was working so everyone is able to develop without errors caused by the database. Nathan is also probably from a non-dirt village in Italy. The next meeting we are going to talk about strides made with react and the framework being developed. We are also going to make sure Nathan is doing well converting the backend Java from project 2 to Javascipt for project 3.
