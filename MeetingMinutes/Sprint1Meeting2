Minutes from Previous Meeting
We accomplished and completed more backend work and completed most of the skeleton code for the manager, cashier, and customer sides. We now need to fill in the code to make it look good. We aren’t going to put the google or OAUTH UI’s into our product yet as we have to make our first site work correctly. Alex wasn’t doing so well on the customer side so we assigned Nicole to help him out as she is kind of a floater.
