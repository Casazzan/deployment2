Before The Next Meeting
Plans:
Remake the server side to incorporate react elements instead of using local storage
Because the server side used a lot of the elements from the customer side like the formatting of orders and the logic using localStorage we need to rework the logic behind that to make everything use react elements.
Work on the manager side formatting

Minutes from Previous Meeting
We have been working on making the new MVP complete with a main menu and all of the products interacting with the backend. We need to fix the formatting of data on the manager side because right now the data is overflowing and we need a way to truncate it. The server side is coming along nicely however the buttons still need to be stylized and it uses the same local storage for its data so we might need to also refractor that if we need to redesign the customer side.
