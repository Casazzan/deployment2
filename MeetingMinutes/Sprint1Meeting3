Minutes from Previous Meeting
Nathan has done very well converting the backend into functions we can use. We have completed most of the frontend in preparation for the demo. We will add the APIs to the frontend this next sprint. The frontend also needs to be connected and Devan is going to do that once everyone finishes merging their branches we will have that set up. We are a bit behind the curve and everyone tried to do it last minute which is not good. The end product will end up suffering and everyone is vowing to do better.
